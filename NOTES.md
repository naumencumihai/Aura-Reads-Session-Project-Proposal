## Notes on this repo

I started by wanting to just create the project memo, but then I also started thinkering/working on some initial test cases.
Gemini API free-tier seems to consistently fails when trying to analyze a full book (The Divine Comedy used as an example), showcasing the need for a localy run LLModel. This approach will also allow for further training, better evaluation and observability

For what, I hope, will become a working and, possibly, marketable application. ðŸ˜Š
