Both palms it join’d and rais’d,\nFixing its steadfast gaze towards the east,\nAs telling God, “I care for naught beside.”\n“Te Lucis Ante,” so devoutly then\nCame from its lip, and in so soft a strain,\nThat all my sense in ravishment was lost.\nAnd the rest after, softly and devout,\nFollow’d through all the hymn, with upward gaze\nDirected to the bright supernal wheels.\nHere, reader! for the truth makes thine eyes keen:\nFor of so subtle texture is this veil,\nThat thou with ease mayst pass it through unmark’d.\nI saw that gentle band silently next\nLook up, as if in expectation held,\nPale and in lowly guise; and from on high\nI saw forth issuing descend beneath\nTwo angels with two flame-illumin’d swords,\nBroken and mutilated at their points.\nGreen as the tender leaves but newly born,\nTheir vesture was, the which by wings as green\nBeaten, they drew behind them, fann’d in air.\nA little over us one took his stand,\nThe other lighted on the’ Opposing hill,\nSo that the troop were in the midst contain’d.\nWell I descried the whiteness on their heads;\nBut in their visages the dazzled eye\nWas lost, as faculty that by too much\nIs overpower’d. “From Mary’s bosom both\nAre come,” exclaim’d Sordello, “as a guard\nOver the vale, ganst him, who hither tends,\nThe serpent.” Whence, not knowing by which path\nHe came, I turn’d me round, and closely press’d,\nAll frozen, to my leader’s trusted side.\nSordello paus’d not: “To the valley now\n(For it is time) let us descend; and hold\nConverse with those great shadows: haply much\nTheir sight may please ye.” Only three steps down\nMethinks I measur’d, ere I was beneath,\nAnd noted one who look’d as with desire\nTo know me. Time was now that air arrow dim;\nYet not so dim, that ’twixt his eyes and mine\nIt clear’d not up what was conceal’d before.\nMutually tow’rds each other we advanc’d.\nNino, thou courteous judge! what joy I felt,\nWhen I perceiv’d thou wert not with the bad!\nNo salutation kind on either part\nWas left unsaid. He then inquir’d: “How long\nSince thou arrived’st at the mountain’s foot,\nOver the distant waves?”—“O!” answer’d I,\n“Through the sad seats of woe this morn I came,\nAnd still in my first life, thus journeying on,\nThe other strive to gain.” Soon as they heard\nMy words, he and Sordello backward drew,\nAs suddenly amaz’d. To Virgil one,\nThe other to a spirit turn’d, who near\nWas seated, crying: “Conrad! up with speed:\nCome, see what of his grace high God hath will’d.”\nThen turning round to me: “By that rare mark\nOf honour which thou ow’st to him, who hides\nSo deeply his first cause, it hath no ford,\nWhen thou shalt be beyond the vast of waves.\nTell my Giovanna, that for me she call\nThere, where reply to innocence is made.\nHer mother, I believe, loves me no more;\nSince she has chang’d the white and wimpled folds,\nWhich she is doom’d once more with grief to wish.\nBy her it easily may be perceiv’d,\nHow long in women lasts the flame of love,\nIf sight and touch do not relume it oft.\nFor her so fair a burial will not make\nThe viper which calls Milan to the field,\nAs had been made by shrill Gallura’s bird.”\nHe spoke, and in his visage took the stamp\nOf that right seal, which with due temperature\nGlows in the bosom. My insatiate eyes\nMeanwhile to heav’n had travel’d, even there\nWhere the bright stars are slowest, as a wheel\nNearest the axle; when my guide inquir’d:\n“What there aloft, my son, has caught thy gaze?”\nI answer’d: “The three torches, with which here\nThe pole is all on fire.” He then to me:\n“The four resplendent stars, thou saw’st this morn\nAre there beneath, and these ris’n in their stead.”\nWhile yet he spoke. Sordello to himself\nDrew him, and cry’d: “Lo there our enemy!”\nAnd with his hand pointed that way to look.\nAlong the side, where barrier none arose\nAround the little vale, a serpent lay,\nSuch haply as gave Eve the bitter food.\nBetween the grass and flowers, the evil snake\nCame on, reverting oft his lifted head;\nAnd, as a beast that smoothes its polish’d coat,\nLicking his hack. I saw not, nor can tell,\nHow those celestial falcons from their seat\nMov’d, but in motion each one well descried,\nHearing the air cut by their verdant plumes.\nThe serpent fled; and to their stations back\nThe angels up return’d with equal flight.",

Of slave,\nThou hast to freedom brought me; and no means,\nFor my deliverance apt, hast left untried.\nThy liberal bounty still toward me keep.\nThat, when my spirit, which thou madest whole,\nIs loosen’d from this body, it may find\nFavour with thee.” So I my suit preferr’d:\nAnd she, so distant, as appear’d, look’d down,\nAnd smil’d; then tow’rds th’ eternal fountain turn’d.\n\nAnd thus the senior, holy and rever’d:\n“That thou at length mayst happily conclude\nThy voyage (to which end I was dispatch’d,\nBy supplication mov’d and holy love)\nLet thy upsoaring vision range, at large,\nThis garden through: for so, by ray divine\nKindled, thy ken a higher flight shall mount;\nAnd from heav’n’s queen, whom fervent I adore,\nAll gracious aid befriend us; for that I\nAm her own faithful Bernard.” Like a wight,\nWho haply from Croatia wends to see\nOur Veronica, and the while ’t is shown,\nHangs over it with never-sated gaze,\nAnd, all that he hath heard revolving, saith\nUnto himself in thought: “And didst thou look\nE’en thus, O Jesus, my true Lord and God?\nAnd was this semblance thine?” So gaz’d I then\nAdoring; for the charity of him,\nWho musing, in the world that peace enjoy’d,\nStood lively before me. “Child of grace!”\nThus he began: “thou shalt not knowledge gain\nOf this glad being, if thine eyes are held\nStill in this depth below. But search around\nThe circles, to the furthest, till thou spy\nSeated in state, the queen, that of this realm\nIs sovran.” Straight mine eyes I rais’d; and bright,\nAs, at the birth of morn, the eastern clime\nAbove th’ horizon, where the sun declines;\nTo mine eyes, that upward, as from vale\nTo mountain sped, at th’ extreme bound, a part\nExcell’d in lustre all the front oppos’d.\nAnd as the glow burns ruddiest o’er the wave,\nThat waits the sloping beam, which Phaeton\nIll knew to guide, and on each part the light\nDiminish’d fades, intensest in the midst;\nSo burn’d the peaceful oriflame, and slack’d\nOn every side the living flame decay’d.\nAnd in that midst their sportive pennons wav’d\nThousands of angels; in resplendence each\nDistinct, and quaint adornment.
