Scarce the ascent\nBegan, when, lo! a panther, nimble, light,\nAnd cover’d with a speckled skin, appear’d,\nNor, when it saw me, vanish’d, rather strove\nTo check my onward going; that ofttimes\nWith purpose to retrace my steps I turn’d.\n\nThe hour was morning’s prime, and on his way\nAloft the sun ascended with those stars,\nThat with him rose, when Love divine first mov’d\nThose its fair works: so that with joyous hope\nAll things conspir’d to fill me, the gay skin\nOf that swift animal, the matin dawn\nAnd the sweet season. Soon that joy was chas’d,\nAnd by new dread succeeded, when in view\nA lion came, ’gainst me, as it appear’d,\n\nWith his head held aloft and hunger-mad,\nThat e’en the air was fear-struck. A she-wolf\nWas at his heels, who in her leanness seem’d\nFull of all wants, and many a land hath made\nDisconsolate ere now. She with such fear\nO’erwhelmed me, at the sight of her appall’d,\nThat of the height all hope I lost. As one,\nWho with his gain elated, sees the time\nWhen all unwares is gone, he inwardly\nMourns with heart-griping anguish; such was I,\nHaunted by that fell beast, never at peace,\nWho coming o’er against me, by degrees\nImpell’d me where the sun in silence rests.\n\nWhile to the lower space with backward step\nI fell, my ken discern’d the form one of one,\nWhose voice seem’d faint through long disuse of speech.\nWhen him in that great desert I espied,\n“Have mercy on me!” cried I out aloud,\n“Spirit! or living man! what e’er thou be!”",

At Rome my life was past\nBeneath the mild Augustus, in the time\nOf fabled deities and false. A bard\nWas I, and made Anchises’ upright son\nThe subject of my song, who came from Troy,\nWhen the flames prey’d on Ilium’s haughty towers.\nBut thou, say wherefore to such perils past\nReturn’st thou? wherefore not this pleasant mount\nAscendest, cause and source of all delight?”\n“And art thou then that Virgil, that well-spring,\nFrom which such copious floods of eloquence\nHave issued?” I with front abash’d replied.\n“Glory and light of all the tuneful train!\nMay it avail me that I long with zeal\nHave sought thy volume, and with love immense\nHave conn’d it o’er.

This beast,\nAt whom thou criest, her way will suffer none\nTo pass, and no less hindrance makes than death:\nSo bad and so accursed in her kind,\nThat never sated is her ravenous will,\nStill after food more craving than before.\nTo many an animal in wedlock vile\nShe fastens, and shall yet to many more,\nUntil that greyhound come, who shall destroy\nHer with sharp pain. He will not life support\nBy earth nor its base metals, but by love,\nWisdom, and virtue, and his land shall be\nThe land ’twixt either Feltro. In his might\nShall safety to Italia’s plains arise,\nFor whose fair realm, Camilla, virgin pure,\nNisus, Euryalus, and Turnus fell.\nHe with incessant chase through every town\nShall worry, until he to hell at length\nRestore her, thence by envy first let loose.\nI for thy profit pond’ring now devise,\nThat thou mayst follow me, and I thy guide\nWill lead thee hence through an eternal space,\nWhere thou shalt hear despairing shrieks, and see\nSpirits of old tormented, who invoke\nA second death; and those next view, who dwell\nContent in fire, for that they hope to come,\nWhene’er the time may be, among the blest,\nInto whose regions if thou then desire\nT’ ascend, a spirit worthier than I\nMust lead thee, in whose charge, when I depart,\nThou shalt be left: for that Almighty King,\nWho reigns above, a rebel to his law,\nAdjudges me, and therefore hath decreed,\nThat to his city none through me should come.\nHe in all parts hath sway; there rules, there holds\nHis citadel and throne. O happy those,\nWhom there he chooses!” I to him in few:\n“Bard! by that God, whom thou didst not adore,\nI do beseech thee (that this ill and worse\nI may escape) to lead me, where thou saidst,\nThat I Saint Peter’s gate may view, and those\nWho as thou tell’st, are in such dismal plight.”",

O high genius! now vouchsafe\nYour aid! O mind! that all I saw hast kept\nSafe in a written record, here thy worth\nAnd eminent endowments come to proof.\n\nI thus began: “Bard! thou who art my guide,\nConsider well, if virtue be in me\nSufficient, ere to this high enterprise\nThou trust me. Thou hast told that Silvius’ sire,\nYet cloth’d in corruptible flesh, among\nTh’ immortal tribes had entrance, and was there\nSensible present. Yet if heaven’s great Lord,\nAlmighty foe to ill, such favour shew’d,\nIn contemplation of the high effect,\nBoth what and who from him should issue forth,\nIt seems in reason’s judgment well deserv’d:\nSith he of Rome, and of Rome’s empire wide,\nIn heaven’s empyreal height was chosen sire:\nBoth which, if truth be spoken, were ordain’d\nAnd ’stablish’d for the holy place, where sits\nWho to great Peter’s sacred chair succeeds.\nHe from this journey, in thy song renown’d,\nLearn’d things, that to his victory gave rise\nAnd to the papal robe. In after-times\nThe chosen vessel also travel’d there,\nTo bring us back assurance in that faith,\nWhich is the entrance to salvation’s way.\nBut I, why should I there presume? or who\nPermits it? not Aeneas I nor Paul.\nMyself I deem not worthy, and none else\nWill deem me. I, if on this voyage then\nI venture, fear it will in folly end.\nThou, who art wise, better my meaning know’st,\nThan I can speak.” As one, who unresolves\nWhat he hath late resolv’d, and with new thoughts\nChanges his purpose, from his first intent\nRemov’d; e’en such was I on that dun coast,\nWasting in thought my enterprise, at first\nSo eagerly embrac’d. “If right thy words\nI scan,” replied that shade magnanimous,\n“Thy soul is by vile fear assail’d, which oft\nSo overcasts a man, that he recoils\nFrom noblest resolution, like a beast\nAt some false semblance in the twilight gloom.\nThat from this terror thou mayst free thyself,\nI will instruct thee why I came, and what\nI heard in that same instant, when for thee\nGrief touch’d me first. I was among the tribe,\nWho rest suspended, when a dame, so blest\nAnd lovely, I besought her to command,\nCall’d me; her eyes were brighter than the star\nOf day; and she with gentle voice and soft\nAngelically tun’d her speech address’d:\n“O courteous shade of Mantua! thou whose fame\nYet lives, and shall live long as nature lasts!\nA friend, not of my fortune but myself,\nOn the wide desert in his road has met\nHindrance so great, that he through fear has turn’d.\nNow much I dread lest he past help have stray’d,\nAnd I be ris’n too late for his relief,\nFrom what in heaven of him I heard. Speed now,\nAnd by thy eloquent persuasive tongue,\nAnd by all means for his deliverance meet,\nAssist him. So to me will comfort spring.\nI who now bid thee on this errand forth\nAm Beatrice; from a place I come.",
